The source files in this directory can be used to compile 'ourtest' (a program
that detects the QRS complex onset of ECG records).

The detection algorithm is based on Hamilton, 2002 (Figure 1):

http://www.cinc.org/archives/2002/pdf/101.pdf

We will call it Hamilton Segmenter.

These source files are derived from https://www.eplimited.com/confirmation.htm.

To compile these sources and run the programs:

1. Install gcc if you have not already done so.  Under MS-Windows, install
   the Cygwin software package available freely from http://www.cygwin.com/.
   Under Mac OS/X, install the Mac OS/X Developer Tools, available freely from
   http://developer.apple.com/macosx/.

2. The ecg data is saved into ecg_data.h. It's the recording 100 first channel
   from http://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb. It's saved using
   the original codes from https://www.eplimited.com/confirmation.htm.

3. Compile the sources by typing:
	make

   The file named 'Makefile' controls what happens when you run
   these 'make' commands.  'Makefile' is a text file that you can
   edit if necessary.

4. Run the application by typing:
	./ourtest
