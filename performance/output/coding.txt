The measurements are encoded with the flags set in the following order:
QRSFILT_OPT
BLOCKING_SIZE_QRSFILT
FASTNOTCH
INIT_INLINE
BDAC_OPT
AVX_OPT
NOISECHECK_OPT

meaning the ALL_0501000 would correspond to the file generated with the pefromance script using the all mode and only the INIT_INLINE flag set.
